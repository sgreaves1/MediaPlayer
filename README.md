# MediaPlayer

A wpf application which will be used to access stored video files and play them through the app.

I also plan to use this app as a remote control for a raspberry pi. Sending play pause ect commands to the pi situated in the bedroom/front room ect

The video files are stored on a raspberry pi so id also like to use the app to organise and rename as well as place film images into the folders as well as trailers ect

The app will also show me whats connected to my local network so i know if the raspberry pi is online

I would also like to be able to download films from the pi to the host machine by a simple button click

I will then add some form of edit mode where only i will be able to edit the films and files so other users (e.g girlfriend) doesnt accidently delete films ect.
